        <b>Martin Gobert</b> (b.2000) is a French visual artist who graduated
        from the photography department of the Royal Academy of Arts in Den Haag
        (The Netherlands) in 2024.<br />He worked as an assistant for
        <i>Helmut Smits</i> (2023), and <i>Thomas Mailaender</i> (2024), which
        helped him to sharpen his interest in conceptual ideas, using found
        footage and the everyday as primal material. His work explores the
        absurdity of human behavior, its environment, and social phenomena. He
        tends to include himself in his work to better understand what he
        explores. <br />Martin has a particular interest in the banal and the
        ordinary. His practice seeks to find things that are no longer
        considered and put them in the spotlight. Inspired by confusion and
        playfulness, his work juggles between absurdity and rationality; between
        humor and seriousness. He likes to create interactive installations that
        include the viewer which encourages them to reflect on their condition.
